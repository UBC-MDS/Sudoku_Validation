    Validate an entire Sudoku board.

    This function checks whether a Sudoku board is valid according to
    standard rules: each row, each column and each 3x3 square must
    contain unique digits from 1 to 9, ignoring placeholder values
    (e.g., 0 or None) for incomplete cells. It combines the checks
    from row_validation, column_validation and square_validation.
